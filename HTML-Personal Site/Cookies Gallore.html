  <h3>Bannana Oat Protein Cookie Ingredients:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Bananas:</strong>You'll want to use very ripe bananas - the ripper the bananas,
      the sweeter the cookies.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Oats:</strong>Use old-fashion oats, or quick oats.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Nut Butter:</strong>You can use peanut butter, or you can also use almound butter
      or seed butter if you have nut allergies.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Vanilla Protein Powder:</strong>1 scoop of your favorite vanilla
      protein powder.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Egg:</strong>One large egg has six grams of protein.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Salt:</strong>a pinch of kosher salt.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Flavor:</strong>Cinnamon and vanilla make these breakfast Cookies
      smell and taste amazing.
    </li>
    <li>
    <strong>Chocolate Chip Cookies:</strong>I use Lily's sugar-free chocolate chips,
    but feel free to use regular semi-sweet chips.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>How to store, freeze, and reheat</h3>
  <p>
    These healthy protein cookies hold up quite well and will even last for 4 days
    in the fridge. They can be eaten at room temperature or warmed in the microwave for 10 seconds.
    <br />
    You can also freeze these cookies for up to three months and thaw for a few hours
    in the fridge or microwave straight from the freezer.
  </p>
  <h3>Protein Cookie Variations:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Swap peanut butter for almound or cashew butter or sunflower butter for a
      nut-free cookie.
    </li>
    <li>
      Switch out the chocolate chips for rasins or dried cranberries.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add chopped pecans or walnuts for extra protein.
    </li>
  </ul>
